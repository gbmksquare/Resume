# BumMo Koo's Resumé

I have 3 years of experience in Objective-C and 6 years of experience in Swift language, and made apps on most of Apple's platform, such as iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS. I've been developing iOS apps since 2012 when I was still a student, and have worked on multiple startups and big companies ever since.



Having lived in Dalian, China for 9 years and currently living in Seoul, Korea, I speak Korean, English, and Chinese.



I arduously follow Apple news and lastest Apple technology. I like experimenting with new information, and share what I learned and experienced and have presented in 9 iOS conferences. I am always inspired by the elegance of user interface and delicacy of API designs by Apple.



## Experience

### Apple WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge Winner

Yut - a Game, _2020_, [GitHub](https://github.com/gbmksquare/WWDC-2020)

I've been chosen as one of the WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge winner by making a Swift Playground that introduces Yut, a traditional Korean game. This is a week-long project using `SceneKit` to teach and play Yut. This was the first time I used `SceneKit` , and I made all 3D assets myself using Blender.
